Let's Make a Healthy Food!

An educational game for kids, teenagers to help them know more about vitamins and minerals in foods. 

On loading, the chef will ask what vitamins and minerals we should consume today, and you will drag and drop the foods on your plate to consider what you want to make. Of course, you have a maximum of three options, since you have limited room on your plate.
When you thin the food is ready, you press the button saying Food is Ready! 

The chef will check the quality and let you know about the result! If you win, Bon Appetite! 
Also, you may fail, so please go back to the kitchen...!
